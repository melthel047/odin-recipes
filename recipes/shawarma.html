        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Shawarma is a popular dish originating from the Middle East.<br>
            It's a popular street food that is traditionally made in the form of spiced
            meats that are stacked <br>on the vertical rotisserie with thin sclices shaved off as it rotates.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was tradionally made with lamb, mutton and chicken though these days you see it with beef too.<br>
            It's commonly served in the form of wrap, though in some countries you see it served on plates with sides such as seasoned rice or fries, and salads.
